# A4_Lib
A4_Lib â€“ aka A4 Idiom Library

The A4 Idiom Library was created to help reduce the cognative complexity and minimize the full life cycle costs of any software written in C++. When applied consistently with the common software patterns in this library, the resulting code for any project will be more robust, more efficient, easier to debug and easier to maintain. 

A4 refers to the ISO 216 paper size. The idiom "rules" applied to this library should fit on a single A4 sheet of paper with a readable font size. (See A4-Rules.pdf for details).  The code in this repository should compile for Linux (GNU >= 4.9) and MS Windows / Visual Studio 2015-2019.
